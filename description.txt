In our testing, we tested that each of the R-type operation codes were successfully recognized and worked, we played around with register files, overwriting some, and worked through some cases of logical shifting. We also went through I-type instructions and jumping. We also made sure to go through all of our op code categories and the different states of the FSM. We used code from psets and our own code, cause why not? It was also helpful to use a lot of loops.
